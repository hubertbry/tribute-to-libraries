        <p>These days, a public library (and especially its reading room) is often one of few places where anyone is welcome, no questions asked. It doesn't matter where you're from, how much you earn, where you work etc. There is no time limit you can spend in a library before you are expected to purchase something. As long as it is within the opening hours, you do not need to part with a single penny, provided you sit in the reading room and don't want to borrow anything.</p>
        <p>I love visiting libraries wherever I am, because they illustrate to me the principle of equal access to and free exchange of knowledge.</p>
